# Breast-Cancer Visualization

Data Source: [Wisconsin Breast Cancer from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
Data Visualization Overview
In this project, data visualization techniques were employed to analyze relationships among Breast Cancer features and their corresponding labels (Malignant - M or Benign - B). The visualizations were created using various libraries including matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.

Graphs Included:
Scatterplots
Bar Graphs
Jointplots
Facet Grid
Violin Plot
Pairplot
Boxplots
Subplots
Correlation Plots

Features Explored:
'id', 'diagnosis', 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', 'perimeter_mean', 'area_mean', 'smoothness_mean', 'compactness_mean', 'concavity_mean', 'concave points_mean', 'symmetry_mean', 'fractal_dimension_mean', 'radius_se', 'texture_se', 'perimeter_se', 'area_se', 'smoothness_se', 'compactness_se', 'concavity_se', 'concave points_se', 'symmetry_se', 'fractal_dimension_se', 'radius_worst', 'texture_worst', 'perimeter_worst', 'area_worst', 'smoothness_worst', 'compactness_worst', 'concavity_worst', 'concave points_worst', 'symmetry_worst', 'fractal_dimension_worst'

These visualizations provide insights into the relationships among the mentioned features and the corresponding label.
